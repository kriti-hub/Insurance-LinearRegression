# Insurance-LinearRegression
From this dataset I am trying to predict how premium charges are affected by a
personâ€™s age, sex, BMI, gender, whether smoker or non-smoker, number of
dependents and the region of his stay. We will also try to analyze the increase in
charges when the person is a smoker as opposed to a non-smoker.
